        '<speak>The Breakfast Club film made us all think about into which category we fell in high school. For most of us, these categories were the first foray into social classism, and how we would develop into adults. And the movie helped us see that, deep inside, we’re all just insecure children, hoping for acceptance and friendship. <break time="300ms"/>The theme song is a bulletproof anthem of the need to be accepted; mutual acceptance across the board. It solidified my friendship with Jan, turning her from a childhood grade-school acquaintance to a dear friend, and the sister she is to me today.<break time="100ms"/> It reassured my place in the life of my first childhood friend, Linda. It gave me courage to move forward and create new, lasting friendships with so many others. <break time="200ms"/> There is a build-up in the bridge at the end that’s quite palpable. Lead singer Jim Kerr is urging, commanding them to come on, call his name. It’s definitive of the feelings we awkward weirdos all can relate to. And then, success in the form of a million “la’s”! The Simple Minds’ Don’t You Forget About Me is today’s countdown song for all these reasons, but also because the song just kicks ass. You probably turn it up when you hear it on the radio too.

        '<speak>A number one hit on the US charts in 1975, Minnie Riperton’s breakout song, Lovin’ You, may make you cringe from the schmaltzy seventies vibe and her crazy high pitched soprano notes, or maybe it’s just the tweeting birds throughout. But I listen to this song and I can close my eyes and imagine being a wide-eyed little boy at West End Elementary School, the kid whose teachers usually agreed was always distracted in the classroom, somewhat of a nuisance. Yep, they actually said that to parents back then. But man, was I cute! Small but loud, full of happiness and innocence. Minnie was diagnosed with breast cancer, shortly after the success of this song and sadly passed away in 1979. On a special Mother’s Day episode of Saturday Night Live a few years back, comedian Maya Rudolph spoke about her mother, whose lullaby ballad was the very same I had always loved. It made me love this song even that much more. <break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/50-to-50/37_Lovin_You_final.mp3"/></speak>',

The overall feel of this song reminds me of classic Fleetwood Mac, the voices are a natural match. <break time="150ms"/> Chris has that Rod Stewart rasp, and Suzi has a simple honesty, similar to that of Bonnie Tyler. <break time="150ms"/> A sincerity that begs your attention. <break time="350ms"/> As a side note, these old videos from the seventies crack me up, with their lack of production value! <break time="250ms"/> But that hair though. <break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/50-to-50/36_Stumblin_In_final.mp3"/></speak>',

We all know they have too many hits to mention, and so many songs to just love, but for the purposes of my lifetime, there are really only two, so this post will be sharing those two. <break time="350ms"/>The first is from the Vietnam era, 1969, and as with most music from that era, it played on the radio well into the seventies, until eventually, it found a home as a Classic Rock anthem. <break time="150ms"/> Gimme Shelter is just a giant song. Studio singer Merry Clayton, who provided additional backing vocals that are pure and full of earthly soul, stole the record. Sad that a song about the atrocities of war can be heralded as a hallmark of legend. <break time="450ms"/>The other, and certainly not lesser, of my two Stones’ songs is, obviously, Angie. <break time="150ms"/>Strip away the metal and you get a silent ballad in its most sincere form. It’s the song I always heard in my head, anytime my mother was sad; even though it was meant as a love song, for me it represented the need to always be able to lift her up and take away her pain. <break time="250ms"/> Even as a little boy, when it played on AM Radio, I was drawn to the emotion of helplessness and longing. <break time="150ms"/> Strangely, it was the first time it occurred to me that my mother had a name, and it was Angie. <break time="150ms"/> It’s impossible to explain the emotions this song makes me feel.

It’s hard to narrow down one favorite, but right after their biggest break-out, Under The Bridge, I find myself drawn to the harmonies and rhythmic bass of Otherside, from 2000’s Californication. Part of the reason I love it so much is that it will always remind me of watching my boys Rob and the Phurk jamming out on guitar and drums in their basement in Bath as I observed in awe. Raw talent, straight off the family tree. It was impossible not to be moved by that.

It was the year I lost faith in God, and watched as two beautiful small children had to move forward in the world, without the most amazing mother I’d ever seen or met. <break time="250ms"/> Mary’s death changed so many lives, including my own selfish, day-to-day existence. Reality planted my very heavy feet that day in October, and I knew, through floods of tears, I would never ever see the world the same way again. <break time="350ms"/> In the weeks and months following the loss of Mary, I spent a lot of time with her babies. Watching them grow and wonder, and try to put their tiny fingers on what the hell happened. <break time="250ms"/> I would cook them grilled cheeses and some soup, and we’d sit on the couch watching Disney movies, hoping to make it all just go away. <break time="250ms"/> I would leave the room to go sob in Mary’s kitchen, trying desperately not to let them see me. <break time="350ms"/> One time, that I can never forget as long as I have memory, as I sat in the kitchen sulking, little Mike wandered over and peeked his chubby cheeks from the doorway and asked, <break time="250ms"/> “Uncle Nicky, why are you crying?” <break time="250ms"/> Immediately I dried my face and said, “I’m not crying Mike, I’m ok.” <break time="250ms"/> He walked into the room, pulled out one of the heavy wood chairs, and climbed up onto his knees to rest his elbows on the table. <break time="250ms"/> Without words or provocation, he began singing along to the song on the radio. <break time="250ms"/> “I don’t care who you are, where you’re from, don’t care what you did, as long as you love me.” <break time="250ms"/> Every single word, clearly, as if he were the littlest Backstreet Boy, never ever taking his eyes away from mine. <break time="250ms"/> In the other room sat the sad little girl without a mommy, watching Tarzan. Mike and I went into the living room to join Angela and as soon as we sat, Phil Collins\', You’ll be In My Heart blared, and she looked up at me. “Oh stop you’re crying, it’ll be alright. Just take my hand, hold it tight. I will protect you from all around you, I will be here, don’t you cry.” As I teared up again, she grabbed my hand. <break time="250ms"/> A 4 and a half year old was reassuring me, with strength and love, that can never ever be matched or lost. <break time="1500ms"/><audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/50-to-50/24_Backstreet_Collins_final3.mp3"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/50-to-50/24_Backstreet_Collins_final2.mp3"/></speak>',

To be able to keep someone you once slept with, went on vacations with, and went to family parties with, in your life, after breaking up, is a really hard thing to do, and I was terrified to do it, which is why we lasted so much longer than we should\'ve. But here he is, still here in my life, still always a presence and a friend to me and my loved ones. When I turned 40, he proved once again his loyalty and kinship by throwing me a very unexpected, very ME, surprise party. And we were already officially split at that point, for almost 3 years, and he was already with his new partner, another surprise in my life, someone who I adore and I think adores me. So Maybe I’m Amazed is a love song, I get it. I know Paul wrote it for the love of his life, Linda. But for me, it’s not a romantic love song, but yes, it’s a love song. A thank you song, to someone who still came around after some really poor behavior on my part, someone who stuck by me through the worst parts of my life, and even now into the good parts.

        '<speak><audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/50-to-50/3_Brolivia_final1.mp3"/> The voice of an angel. A.M. Radio’s sweetheart. Olivia Newton-John, also MY sweetheart. <break time="250ms"/> As a little boy, I recognized the gift she gave us with her voice. Chris and I had an opportunity to meet her a few years back, after her concert in the round, and I got a chance to tell her the story I’m about to share. <break time="350ms"/> I remember being a tiny little Nicky, sitting on the stairs watching my mom do the laundry. Have You Never Been Mellow, came on W.G.B.B., and my mother started humming along and said to me, \'Nicky, this is what an angel sounds like.\'  <break time="250ms"/> I can never forget that moment, etched on my heart and in my memory until I die.  <break time="150ms"/> Then I grew up, and Olivia’s sound changed a little, but her voice was still as sweet and perfect as always. And in the confines of that room in the Poconos, I discovered the soundtrack to Xanadu. <break time="250ms"/> Then Suddenly, a duet with Cliff Richard, entered the top 10 with continuous radio air play.  <break time="250ms"/> I think it may have been the most beautiful love song I had ever heard. Though I had no experience with love, I recognized the emotion and the beauty. As an adult I understand the true gift of Olivia’s voice. Such a rare thing to possess. And now when I listen to these songs, not only am I taken back to wondrous, simpler times, I am immediately calmed. Her music calms this savage wildebeest. <break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/50-to-50/3_Brolivia_final2.mp3"/></speak>',

        '<speak>Hormones. Confusion. Sexual awakening. A dark, lonely closet. A Total Eclipse Of The Heart. <break time="250ms"/> It was my first time ever away from home, the first semester of my freshman year at the University of Scranton. I was a scared little seventeen-year-old who had been sheltered and frightened into thinking that my true nature was evil and sick. <break time="250ms"/> And now I was living in a dormitory with virile, hairy boys. <break time="50ms"/> My escapes, as usual, were music, and the daily collect calls to New York City to chat with Karen, and her artsy, soulful new boyfriend, Steven. Now please understand, I had no idea what love was. I thought I knew, in those moments when I used to force myself to believe I could love a girl. When I would pray, as hard as I could, for god to take it away and make me normal, so I could be a real man. <break time="250ms"/> And there were many girls for me to love, and many who I knew loved me. But inside my soul, I knew it was wrong, and certainly not fair to them.<break time="250ms"/> I don’t even know what I expected, as I left home to go to school. Maybe things would change there. And still I prayed at night, against my emerging true nature. And then they sent me a ticket to N.Y.C. on the Greyhound. I left Scranton and arrived in N.Y.C. to be greeted by Karen, Steven and Robert. And in a moment, it was there. The first ever spark of what was real and true. <break time="150ms"/> Steven’s eyes and my eyes had both seen something finally recognizable. It was truly the first time I saw what could be. Without too many details, let’s just say we became pen pals and he helped me begin the road to my self-discovery. <break time="250ms"/> Total Eclipse was the heart-wrenching soundtrack of that route. <break time="250ms"/> Wherever he is in this mad world, I’m certain my Heathcliff hears this song and thinks about me, the way I still think about him. And my forever friend Karen. <break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/50-to-50/2_Total_Eclipse_final.mp3"/></speak>',

Heavy pounding on the piano, a voice that cuts the air, like a hot knife through butter, a rhythm that makes you want to sway, and bouncy harmonies to which you must involuntarily bob your head. <break time="250ms"/> Hall And Oates had so many pop hits in the eighties, but this is the one that turned them from a blue-eyed soul group from Philly, to the top ten superstars of pop music.<break time="350ms"/> As anyone who knows me know, I tried desperately to steal John Oates’ style, with the caterpillar mustache and permed curls. <break time="150ms"/>  Between John’s look, and Daryl Hall’s icy blue voice, Hall And Oates are the curators of my mid-teen life. <break time="150ms"/> Ayngst, blues, and love’s tears. <break time="250ms"/>Kiss On My List. This SONG is on my list of the best things in life.

        '<speak>Of all the music in all the genres from all the time eras, it’s been REALLY difficult to cull down 50-ish songs as favorites. <break time="150ms"/> I love music. Music is joy and sorrow, an outlet and a hope chest.<break time="150ms"/> Songs represent my mood, my feelings, my opinions, my celebrations. <break time="150ms"/>Most days I am just a confused 12 year old boy, trapped in the skin of a 50 year old man, living in the world. <break time="150ms"/>But some days there is clarity, and I have it all figured out. <break time="150ms"/> I’m here as the recorder of events, the keeper of the memories of those who’ve passed. I remind the rest of us of their joys, triumphs, and tragedies. <break time="250ms"/>Each one of those passed loved ones has at least one song, that brings them right beside me, keeping their vibe strong.<break time="150ms"/> My own memories in my very blessed life are also outlined by so many songs. Too many to list. <break time="150ms"/> Today as I turn 50 years old on this sad but beautiful green and blue marble, I am drawn to this song, the finale from my favorite Broadway musical, In The Heights. <break time="150ms"/> The unassuming lead character of the piece realizes, in a moment of lucidity, that it’s his job to be the recorder, the streetlight, that illuminates the stories of the people he loves. <break time="150ms"/>If not me, who keeps their legacies? If not for so many people from so many points in my life, I never ever could have come to this spot, this point in my world. A pinnacle of accomplishments, most of which are relationship-based, because what is life without connection, without community? I thank my Woof Christopher for so many things, but mostly for bringing the joy of musical theatre to my life as a necessity, not just a thing to do. <break time="150ms"/> I thank my family of friends, way too many to list but I hope you know who you are, for lifting me up and allowing me to burn brightly as the necessary street lamp at the corner of the street. And I thank my mother Angie and my sisters Mary and Rosemarie for teaching me so much about love: how to do it properly so that your life is fulfilled. <break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/50-to-50/0_Finale_final.mp3"/></speak>',

Most were ballads, some were classic pop tunes, but each was a song that defines an era, no matter how small, of my life. After December 21st, 2015, I began to realize there were still so many songs I love. So naturally that led to this year’s 51 to 51.<break time="250ms"/> I feel like music is such a huge part of my day to day life (and it has been since the seventies) just as much as talking about or writing about myself is, for anyone willing to listen or read. <break time="200ms"/> Therefore, I present to you my Top 51 to 51 Countdown for 2016.<break time="150ms"/> I hope you enjoy it, and that you will chime in with your own memories, even if to make fun and be silly. That’s what it’s all for, finding the joy. <break time="550ms"/>Today, we start with a song that is the most current on the list, one with a beautiful melody, and lyrics that talk about the difficulty of finding a light at the end of the tunnel. We medicate, hoping to feel better, hoping for the sadness to dissipate; hoping that when the cough syrup goes down, the woes will go away. <break time="250ms"/>As someone who has fought against depression for more than half my life, I hear these lyrics and am reminded that every day is a new battle, but it’s not one I’m willing to lose.

But this one, as many songs do, reminds me of that little angel on my shoulder, Angie. <break time="150ms"/> Admittedly I don’t know the song from when it was a hit on the radio in nineteen sixty-six. <break time="150ms"/> My memory of this particular tune comes from our time in the Poconos, a time when we all yearned to find happiness somehow. <break time="150ms"/> Especially, I think, my mother. <break time="150ms"/> In those small moments when they’d have weekend guests, they’d go out coupling to one of the resort hotels that showcased bands from the past. Angie was enamored with lead singer Tom Giuliano of the Happenings, and he was always so gracious to my parents and their friends after their shows at Paradise Stream. I remember this song fondly, as my mom would sing it acapella in the kitchen days later, as the veil would begin to fade.

A lot happened in such a small amount of time, not the least of which was discovering and falling in love with the new sound of new wave, on a radio station called W.L.I.R. <break time="250ms"/> Pop music at that moment in time was muddled and disjointed, so finding this left of center type of sound was pretty much a mirror of my finding my own awakening. <break time="150ms"/>I was working at the Green Acres Mall, at a store called Jeans West. <break time="150ms"/> On my breaks, I’d walk down to Sam Goody to listen to music on those bulky, padded headphones attached to the walls. I’d heard this song on W.L.I.R. a few times already, but I found the cassette at Sam Goody and decided to listen to it to try and learn the words. Talk about a one hit wonder; this wasn’t even ever a hit, but it sticks in my head as the stand out song that solidified my love for new wave, and latching me to being rebellious and unusual.

There’s something about me that finds comfort in the music that played around me when I was at my very lowest. Late 1997 into 1998 was, as anyone who knows my life story, the very worst period of my life. The period that shook my foundation and remolded me into a different person. Hollow and sad, and so so lost, I first felt the experience of being rallied around by those in my orbit. <break time="150ms"/> It’s when I first realized I’d even had an orbit. <break time="150ms"/>That as lonely as I felt, I was NOT alone. Not ever.<break time="350ms"/> Mary’s shocking and sudden death, the babies’ bereft cried-out faces, etched into my memory as if scribbled in black sharpie on the backs of my eyelids, brought about the kindness and goodness of people, and strangely, added color to my lackluster life. Colors I’d never experienced.<break time="250ms"/> They were not pretty colors, but they were colors nonetheless, and I needed to be able to fill in the blanks of my life with them from that point forward. <break time="150ms"/> Each day I went to work wishing it had been me in that coffin, but I kept realizing I was surrounded by people who genuinely cared about me. <break time="150ms"/>And the music that played behind us, though at the time may not have been so important, now sings hauntingly to me as a reminder of all those sad but beautiful colors and emotions. Of being empathically carried by the people around me. <break time="150ms"/>Each of today’s songs reminds me of that time, when as lonely as it felt having to be among the living, I was never alone. <break time="1500ms"/><audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/51-to-51/46_Drive_Semisonic_etc_final1.mp3"/><audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/51-to-51/46_Drive_Semisonic_etc_final2.mp3"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/51-to-51/46_Drive_Semisonic_etc_final3.mp3"/></speak>',

(On this year’s countdown alone there are 16 songs from this era of soft rock.)<break time="200ms"/> Lotta Love is high on the list of favorites from 1977. It’s safely before the onset of punk and new wave, when A.M. Radio still reigned. <break time="150ms"/>I love the earthiness of this chick; it’s sad she didn’t have as huge a career as her contemporaries.

I hear the lyrics as magnified through my own lens: <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/51-to-51/17_I_Love_You_Final1.mp3"/> I wish I could find her and let her know how instrumental she was in saving my life.

I literally can’t. <break time="200ms"/> This song came out when I was in college, at the U of Scranton. I was still firmly in the closet, denying I liked music by anyone androgynous. George Michael wasn’t androgynous, but he did give off that gay vibe, and admitting I liked him, to me, meant outing myself. <break time="100ms"/> So I would play this song alone in my dorm room, hoping no one was around to judge and put the puzzle pieces together. And I’d hope the video would come on in the background so I could look at his face. Some may argue Everything She Wants isn’t the best song by Wham!, but I wholeheartedly disagree. Great lyrics, bouncy eighties synths, so much better than Wake Me Up. But really, it’s all about this video. <break time="750ms"/>  P.S. His name is Andrew Ridgeley.

But for me,  this song stands the test of time, reminding me that I have it all inside me to be strong and stay on course, in a life that has no road map. There’s a feel to this song that is hard to describe. It could be among a number of things, including the pangs of nostalgia. Either way, this song brings me joy and confidence. I was so happy that it was included in the movie Bridesmaids, because the girls of Wilson Phillips were included in the joke, making it not a joke at all but a lovely memory from, ‘back in the day’. <break time="150ms"/>I guess that’s the best way to describe this song.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/51-to-51/5_Hold_ON_Final2.mp3"/> </speak>',

You can say so much about George Michael, and you can try and pigeon hole him into some kind of category, but I always knew this was an artist, a brilliant soul, inside a beautiful face, with a sexy voice. <break time="150ms"/> A rare, ballsy talent washed in ambiguous sexuality. The first song today is Freedom 90, made popular by the super-models in the video, but with the slight gay undertones that I had been looking for all along. It’s his coming of age song, the start of his open closet door. I can go on for days about this song. It is perfection; the fugue of his smoky voice over itself throughout the verse and chorus. <break time="150ms"/> The video features the most beautiful women in the world, lip synching his words with the complete absence of the singer himself. <break time="150ms"/> Brilliant. <break time="150ms"/> And then there’s the out-and-proud George, amid the turmoil of American tabloid nonsense, looking more mature but still as sexy as ever as he brings us FastLove, one of the sexist songs ever by anyone. <break time="150ms"/> This was a blaster; it was on one of our Structure tapes, and I would rewind it and blast it during those moments when I was the only one in the store. I can still close my eyes and be taken elsewhere.

How can there be anything better than that? <break time="250ms"/> Next, and keeping with the inimitably classic Jewfro, is Woman In Love, a ballad from 1981, another in that string of Bee Gees hits I’ve talked about on this year’s countdown.

But my nephew with the eclectic ear really liked this band so I gave it my interest, and now that it’s retro, I have to say I love the damn song. <break time="150ms"/> Aside from the obvious connection to my nephew, I do like the pared down simplicity in the lead singer’s voice and the sweetness of the guitars. I can even appreciate the record-scratch sound. <break time="150ms"/> And the song has a pretty good message about overcoming fear, which has gripped many of us too many times to count in our lives.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/53-to-53/53_Drive_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

Perhaps I’ve talked about the life-changing experience that was my first time seeing U2 at the Hartford Civic Center (not shockingly, I remember the date - May 9, 1987) in my previous entries about one of their songs, but in the context of this diary, the essence of that moment should find its home again. <break time="250ms"/>It was the closest I’d ever felt to the existence of a god and community and love. I was at the concert with my brother Mike and Jan and Jayne and Kenny, and these people were my family, the walls of my house. <break time="150ms"/> I was also amongst a crowd of humans from everywhere who swayed and sung and cried to the rattle and hum of the Irish rock phenomenon.<break time="150ms"/> As we exited the venue. Zombie-like, it was full-on lighters lit as we all were still singing, How long to sing this song? <break time="250ms"/>  Today’s two particular U2 songs couldn’t be further away in style and feel from each other, but they are each as meaningful and powerful to me and my whole life. <break time="150ms"/> The first is from my time peeking out through the slats on the closet door, way back in my sophomore year of college, when longing for boys across the campus or in the dorm was my only course of action AND study. <break time="250ms"/>The second is from after the closet door was broken off its hinges, at a time when I was in the throes of self-discovery, learning responsibility and forging lifetime friendships. <break time="150ms"/> I give you New Year’s Day, a gritty tale about an ongoing bloody struggle, and One, about disharmony and disappointment and the ramifications of those things.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/53-to-53/52_U2_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

That’s part of the cult charm. <break time="250ms"/>It’s a wink to be in on the joke, to be able to lipsync along with the lips in the opening sequence during the opening number, Science Fiction Double Feature. Clearly, not all the songs are favorites, but as a whole the movie soundtrack holds up to the task. My personal stand-outs are, of course, Touch-a Touch-a Touch Me, sung by the ingénue, a very young and innocent Susan Sarandon, and the songs that comprise the penultimate floor show, which happens to be a visual feast as well.

        '<speak>This is basically a snapshot of the best of Bon Jovi, I know. <break time="150ms"/> Clearly, they were one of the best bands of their genre to emerge from the eighties, and keep on keepin’ on, for many years after that particular lighter flame should have faded. <break time="150ms"/> Anyone who’s alive knows Livin’ On A Prayer. And likely 97% of those people love it and sing along to it the way they do to Don’t Stop Believin’, Journey’s mega-hit. <break time="150ms"/>This song was reminiscent of its classic rock ancestors including Zeppelin and Frampton, but it has that eighties edge that, strangely, still holds up right to this minute.<break time="150ms"/> With their hair-band notoriety on point, Bon Jovi even does a chord change at the end that would make any Bee-Gee or Manilow fan proud. <break time="250ms"/> From the same 1987 album came Wanted: Dead or Alive, a different kind of rock anthem. <break time="150ms"/> This one was more reminiscent of Bob Seger or the Eagles than heavy metal, and it resonated just as much. With such an amazing instrumental bridge, it’s impossible to not jam out your best air guitar and mimic that squinty face Richie Sambora made as he killed it. <break time="150ms"/> The harmonies between Jon and Richie at the end though, are why I love this song, and it’s about 2 simple words: Me and Kenny. <break time="250ms"/> It was the summer he and Cristine fell in love, in which the three of us were inseparable; movies, drinking, camping, Bon Jovi. <break time="450ms"/>Fast forward 13 years: under the radar comes a ballad called What Do You Got. This ballad deserves honorary mention because it has such a pretty lyric: What do ya got if you ain’t got love? If you ain’t got love, it’s all just keepin’ score. <break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/53-to-53/50_Bon_Jovi_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

Bad Girl reminds me of so much. The arrangement of this song, to me, has become synonymous to the crashing waves on the rainy, cold shores of Montauk, where I’d stare out in sadness every time I’d spend that January weekend with Jan and the girls at Gurney’s Inn. I’d sit and reflect on what a terrible, calculating human I was.

It was part of the soundtrack of my childhood that had been provided by W.G.B.B. in our small kitchen in Lynbrook, where Mommy would comb my stubborn hair and send me off to West End. <break time="150ms"/> The singer had a soft, interesting voice that drew me in; the lyrics, about her love for a man, didn’t matter to me, and it NEVER occurred to me this song was written as a ballad sung by Mary Magdalene to Jesus of Nazareth. <break time="350ms"/> It was in the way her voice climbed to such a delightfully golden soprano, the crescendo of the chorus, that was so simply breathtaking.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/53-to-53/48_I_Don\'t_Know_How_to_Love_Him_Final.mp3"/> The singer, Helen Reddy, had had several songs in the morning soundtrack.<break time="150ms"/> Among them was Angie Baby, which was one of my mom’s favorite with which to sing along, since it was her name. But I Don’t Know How To Love Him, for certain, is the most beautiful of all of the songs sung to pitch perfection by Helen Reddy. There have been many versions of this song, most famously that sung by Yvonne Elliman who’d sung it in both the stage and screen productions of Jesus Christ Superstar, as well as the recent (and brilliant) version by Sara Bareilles. Helen’s, though, remains my gold standard. </speak>',

There are several songs on this year’s countdown by bands in this genre. The Verve Pipe is known for their one-hit wonder called the Freshman. It garnered a ton of airplay in 1996 and 97. But the song I love by this obscure band is called La La. <break time="250ms"/>It wasn’t even released as a single, so finding a video for it was impossible.

        '<speak>How do you describe the voice of John Legend? <break time="150ms"/> Pointed, unpretentious, sweet and brimming, with the spirit of so many crooners from our past. Except here he is, in the now. <break time="150ms"/> He sings about love and loss, just like any other balladier. But the song I love most by this master of swoon is If You’re Out There. <break time="150ms"/> Wistful, yet hopefully aspirational lyrics tell of joining together to make this one earth a better place. <break time="150ms"/> We all talk about it and we all say we want it, but too few of us actually stand up. It takes artists like John legend to throw these issues at us in beauty and style.<break time="150ms"/> Listen to this song and be empowered. <break time="350ms"/>Honorary mention goes to the first song I’d ever heard by this genius with a beautiful voice: Someday.<break time="150ms"/> From the August Rush film soundtrack. <break time="250ms"/> Chris and I saw the movie in the theater, and as we sat through the credits, I was blown away by the splendor and simplicity of this song, about lovers once again meeting up someday, much like what happened in the movie. <break time="150ms"/> But I heard the message of someday being together with my recently departed Vincent, while in the infancy of a new love with Chris. The definition of bittersweet.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/53-to-53/41_John_Legend_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

It rained a lot here in Scranton, in the fall of 1984. And that suits me just fine. It clears off the campus thoroughfares and allows me to walk aimlessly, alone. I’m aware of my youth and my secret desperation. I’m aware of how lonely and alone I am, and I wonder what it’s like to have a lover to walk with and talk with as Annie Lennox requests in the chorus of her Eurythmics’ song Here Comes the Rain Again. I’m about to walk along the winding path that leads through the main commons. No one is out tonight, no one but me, walking quietly in the drumming, steady rain.

The first time I’d ever heard her was during a shift at Structure in the Green Acres Mall, shortly after the start of my 4-year stint, on our audio track system. <break time="150ms"/> The song was called Good Enough; with an ongoing soundtrack of mindless nonsense in the background of a retail environment, this song made me stop and listen. <break time="150ms"/> The message was powerful and commanding. <break time="350ms"/> I was hooked. Next came I Will Remember You, a quietly beautiful song that, at first, reminded me of my dad, for whom I hadn’t really mourned much because I hadn’t understood a truly deep degree of loss. <break time="150ms"/> It wasn’t until the unexpected death of my dear friend Amy (whom I spoke of 2 days ago when I blogged about dancing at my first ever gay bar to Jody Watley) that I truly knew what it was to feel hollow and lost; this song was forever my anthem to her. <break time="150ms"/> Sarah McLachlan was among the pioneers of a female rock movement, topping charts and dominating concert venues. Many of her subsequently released songs were really just as good as the two that first hooked me. She paved the road for Alanis Morissette, Natalie Merchant, Joan Osborne and so many others, right up to the current powerhouse that is Sara Bareilles. <break time="150ms"/> And I’m okay with her voice being the voice of the voiceless; her music is that moving.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/53-to-53/33_Sarah_McLachlan_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

Certainly it’s not for me. It’s a permanent solution to momentary madness that inevitably leaves lives destroyed. You’ve devastated your mother and sister and lover and all your friends and co-workers and the list is endless, because when you decide to jump, you’re not thinking about anyone or anything but how miserable you are. <break time="150ms"/> But that isn’t everything, is it?

Joey Henderson and I were the only boys in the class (or maybe Bobby Melk was there too?) and this song takes me immediately back to that moment. Years later the real story behind the song is told and I fall in love with it all over again. As relative unknowns, Nile and the band Chic tried to gain access to the exclusive Studio 54 and were readily turned away. One of the band members shouted, Fuck off!, to the bouncer, and as they walked away, the song was born and became the song we know now.<break time="350ms"/> Fast forward to 2013.<break time="150ms"/> Daft Punk releases Get Lucky, a catchy bounce-fest featuring the voice of Pharrell, but unmistakably bearing the signature funky guitars of Nile Rodgers.

Even just narrowing to two was tough, but here they are.<break time="250ms"/> First up is a song from the early part of Sir Elton’s career, when his music was less pop and more story-telling. <break time="150ms"/> But I just happen to love Harmony because, surprise-surprise, my big sister Rosemarie loved it, and therefore it reminds me of her face when she was the most beautiful girl in the world, back when the days were never-ending and life was simple. <break time="150ms"/> It’s hard to express the way I felt about her back then; she was just as magnificent as any of those celebrities I admired, but I didn’t have to share her with the world. She was mine and I was hers. <break time="250ms"/> I hear Harmony and I am instantly eight years old and my sister still lives in our house; she hasn’t gotten married yet so I still get to play her records and go on walks in the park with her. <break time="350ms"/>I love the way this song will always make me feel, connected to the most special person to have ever affected my life. <break time="450ms"/> Next is a heartbreaking ballad sung about Elton’s dear friend John Lennon who, not long before the song was written, was murdered outside his home in the presence of his wife. <break time="150ms"/> Everyone alive in the seventies and eighties knows the story, but Elton John put into words how the world felt after Lennon’s murder. <break time="150ms"/> Bereft, empty, confused. <break time="150ms"/> Such a beautiful song about such a sad moment in our collective history. <break time="150ms"/> So it turns out my favorite Elton John songs are super-downers; I suppose I could have gone with his kitschy duet with Kiki Dee, or one of his many, MANY castle-storming monsters like the Bitch Is Back, or Saturday Is Alright for Fighting, or Philadelphia Freedom, or Bennie And The Jets, or<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/53-to-53/22_Elton_John_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

        '<speak>Later into the nineties, amid the absolute worst moment in my small, predictable life, I found comfort in a guitar-and-strings ballad by an alt-punk band, whose sound was usually crass and boisterous. <break time="250ms"/> It was called Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life). <break time="150ms"/>Frank and I have always equated this song to our loss of Mary. It’s not necessarily because of the lyrics; the melody is a melancholy sound that seems fitting for her very short, bittersweet life. <break time="150ms"/> I guess, when Billy Joe sings, I hope you had the time of your life, it’s equal to the hope that she was happy and that she knew she was loved and that she knew how very much she meant to so many people. <break time="250ms"/> I’ve written at length about losing Mary.

Listening to it now is like a master-class lesson in what post-grunge nineties music was all about - beautiful vocals that spoke of hope and security in an uncertain time. <break time="250ms"/> The years prior to October 1997 are hard to describe for me, because I don’t think I really lived yet before then. <break time="150ms"/> I existed but I was a shadow of what I’d eventually become.

I mean, holy shit, how could you not love, and maybe want to make out with, Billy Idol? <break time="250ms"/>His brand of punk pop rock was everywhere in the early to mid-eighties. All over M.T.V. and Z. 100. <break time="150ms"/> With the release of Rebel Yell, Billy Idol was no longer just a punk, but an ambassador of the era, and part of that role included what seemed to be a bit of a softer side. <break time="150ms"/> Eyes Without A Face evoked curiosity and intrigue, what with the backup singer mirroring his words in French. Les yeux sans visage, was this song a ballad? A ballad by a punk rocker? <break time="150ms"/> Halfway through the song, kick ass guitar riffs and ass-claps tell a different story, a more familiar tale of kick-assery. <break time="350ms"/> On the same album, was Flesh For Fantasy. <break time="150ms"/> Pop punk played to death on the radio for good reason.  With the flood of every other Billy Idol song, this was the one that made me want to be a punk. <break time="150ms"/> Parachute pants and high hair. Whatever you call them, for me Eyes Without A Face is a memory of romance and intrigue and I still love it any time I hear it, and Flesh For Fantasy will always remind me of the rebel I’d wished I could be, the one that perhaps only cousin Cristine could see.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/53-to-53/16_Billy_Idol_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

Whose song, Kiss On My List, beat out Bonnie Tyler’s Total Eclipse Of The Heart as my favorite song of all time? Yep, that’s correct. Daryl Hall and John Oates. <break time="150ms"/>Their catalog is endless. Their seventies music is timeless, and their eighties music is classic nostalgia. <break time="150ms"/> There is no disputing that Daryl Hall’s voice is quite possibly one of the most beautiful male voices ever to be recorded, but at the start of their career, it was John Oates whose voice led the hits. Case in point, today’s masterpiece retelling of the Righteous Brothers’ classic, You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling. <break time="150ms"/> From the first few beats of bass, I am in eyes-closed swooning mode. <break time="150ms"/> It might be the first song I ever recorded off the radio (by holding my tape recorder against the radio and pressing record as the song began) so I could play it over and over and over again, as I did/still do. <break time="150ms"/> Fourteen year old me wasn’t much different than nearly-53-me, in that we both love this song so much and the blending of both their voices still gives me chills. <break time="150ms"/> There’s something entirely masculine (I know, weird descriptor to use, but) about Oates’ voice in contrast to the beautiful high voice of Hall, that blends them to perfection in a song that demands to be played loud. So many of their hits still leave me speechless. <break time="150ms"/> Maneater. Private Eyes. Say It Isn’t So. Out Of Touch. <break time="150ms"/> I could go on and on. But today, let’s play the shit out of this Intro to 80’s instant classic, that turned the original on its ear with boss vocals and a modern bass. Thank you, Daryl and John, for everything.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/53-to-53/13_Hall_And_Oates_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

No, not the city (though I actually really loved the city the one time we’ve ever visited). <break time="150ms"/> No, I’m talking about Chicago, the kick-ass rock and horns band from the late sixties and early seventies. <break time="1500ms"/> It’s impossible to count their hits on two hands, but all of my favorite songs are from their early days. Chicago provided part of the soundtrack of my childhood on Wright Avenue. The Archie Bunker-like curmudgeon who was my dad, an avid listener of music from the Big Band Era, really liked Chicago’s sound – the mix of contemporary rock with the most amazing arrangements of horns. <break time="150ms"/> Their sound was unique; no one was producing the kinds of amazing ballads and pop tunes that this group of musicians was doing, to perfection. <break time="150ms"/> I have chosen one of their most famous releases, along with a melancholy ballad, to be today’s top songs by Chicago. Call On Me starts with percussion and then the horns. Oh, those horns! This was one of my dad’s favorites. It’s also one of mine. It elicits summer breezes in the backyard with family gatherings, Chicago playing on the 8-track player from the garage. In all the years I knew my parents as a married couple, I think the only time I ever saw them as two people who were into each other was this era, around 1974, with Chicago playing the score. <break time="250ms"/>Then there is the ballad Wishing You Were Here, from the same album with such a different tone. Needless to say, the message to this song is pretty clear. Always wishing they were here. <break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/53-to-53/4_Call_On_Me_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

I picture Tawny Kitaen as the Debbie they’re speaking about, and if you remember her the way I do, she was everything in 1985. <break time="150ms"/> Aside from all of this, the song has a catchy bop that I just really happen to enjoy.

And though Jake is holding Caroline, we all know this song belongs to him and Samantha. Even as Caroline gives him some lame ultimatum, he clearly doesn’t give a shit because it’s Samantha on whom he has set his sights.  And then there’s the classic ending, the perfect clincher for every daydreaming teenaged girl (and gay boy), as Jake meets Samantha at the church.

No one reads these things and certainly no one has been reading them every year, and DEFINTELY no one remembers what I’ve written in previous years’ posts!), Journey was on my countdown with Who’s Crying Now, another monster power ballad, and what I love about both of these songs is the amazing vocal strength of Steve Perry.

This song played in the backdrop of my freshman year at college when I pined to be normal, when all I’d wanted was to either get cured of what was clearly wrong with me or be spirited away in a Legion cruiser to the far-flung future. The sentimental value of the line, “roses never fade,” three simple words sung by this light from the universe, echoed inside my scared head as I would beg god to make me normal so I could feel the feelings I was supposed to feel for the girl who was perfect for me.

It reminds me of my high school savior Maria (a common person to whom so much music from that time period usually pulls me back), and our Friday nights watching videos and having sleep-overs. It was during those moments with Maria that I began to find courage and confidence, and when I hear this song I am reminded of her friendship and support. So here it is today.

I barely remember my father bringing her home for us, but I do remember the stories of how small she was and how she fit in the palm of his hand. <break time="150ms"/> In Lynbrook she’d been the family pet, but once we’d moved to the woods in ’79, she became mine; my best friend, my sleeping buddy, my only confidante in a lonely wood-paneled room. <break time="250ms"/>She had gone blind just before then so my empathy muscles, which most people don’t develop until much later (and some not at all), sharpened and I spent a lot of time coaching her around the house so she wouldn’t hurt herself. <break time="150ms"/> We became inseparable, except for the hours when I was off at school. <break time="150ms"/> According to stories told by my mother, Cheri would hear the theme song for General Hospital at 3pm, perk her head up, and immediately dart, blindly but with precision, to park her little grey butt just a few inches from the front door, eagerly awaiting my impending arrival home, at which time excessive tail-wagging would commence and she would become my shadow, wherever in the house I’d roam. <break time="250ms"/> Cheri became very ill that year, 1981, and it was decided that she needed to be put to sleep. <break time="250ms"/> Yes, that’s what they called it, and maybe even still do. <break time="150ms"/>I remember quite vividly begging to go with my father and brother Carmine to the vet to be with her for her last moments, but I was denied. <break time="150ms"/>Instead I held her one last time and sang this song to her through tears, handed her to Carmine and recoiled to my bedroom for pretty much the remainder of that summer. Little did I know that that loss would still never prepare me for the inevitable onslaught: dad, best friend, sister-in-law, godmother, best friend, mom, godfather, sister, best friend, mother-in-law, brother, sister-in-law… endless, inevitable onslaught. And I’m in no way looking forward to losing my current shadow, Little Frankie, but I guess we’ll cross that rainbow bridge when we get to it.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/54-to-54/9_Time_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

        '<speak>What was never one of my favorite songs by the Material Girl turned out to be one of my very favorite cover recordings by the boys in the New Directions Glee Club on Glee. <break time="150ms"/> Obviously, it made bittersweet sense in context if you knew the show, but the fact that boys are singing What It Feels Like For A Girl, and the fact that they’re singing it beautifully with sweet harmonies, helps the lyrics pop the way they were intended. So much about Glee resonated with me, but when the perfect song was sung just perfectly, as was demonstrated in my 51 to 51 countdown with Rachel (Lea Michele) Berry’s version of Firework, it was hard to not take notice. <break time="150ms"/> The producers sometimes chose just the right song, and then it was sung as beautifully and as moving as this one. It’s no wonder a person could add it to their list of favorites. <break time="150ms"/>And then there’s Rachel Berry’s moving and personal cover of the ages-old Make You Feel My Love. You’ve heard this song done by many artists, notably Adele and Billy Joel, but this version was recorded for the show, just after the death of cast mate (and real-life boyfriend of Lea Michele) Cory Monteith, and it aired during their memorial episode to the character Finn. <break time="150ms"/> As I’m writing this I am tearing up remembering those emotions: sadness for a life, full of richness and hope, snuffed out by fame and addiction. <break time="150ms"/> The actors were acting, but were they really?

I mentioned this in so many of my previous posts, but I really had a wonderful golden childhood. Properly sheltered, adequately loved, comforted by neighborhood friends with whom I still converse.

This, too, you also know if you’ve been reading my countdown blogs, and again I must thank you for finding me and my musical opinions even the least bit interesting. <break time="150ms"/> That being stated, you know Berlin as the band who released that earworm ballad in the late eighties, from that Tom Cruise movie with the planes and the testosterone. <break time="150ms"/> I know Berlin from their string of amazing hits that were part of my early love affair with new wave music. <break time="150ms"/> There is something about the voice of lead singer Teri Nunn that exudes sex and passion; it makes you want to close your eyes and move in whatever direction your body allows. I’ve already captured my love for their song No More Words in my first countdown six years ago, but that won’t stop me from adding another Berlin monster to this year’s countdown. <break time="150ms"/> In the post-Papa Don’t Preach era, while huge pop-acts like Madonna, George Michael and Salt n\' Pepa were making everyone everywhere start talking about sex, Berlin subversively gave us a song called Sex (I’m A..) about bondage and role play and everything in between. <break time="150ms"/> It’s fast paced like a racing heart. It’s also perhaps a little demeaning to women and certainly not for the feminist, but then with Teri Nunn in control, maybe that’s just exactly what it IS. <break time="150ms"/> After all, in her own words, it’s a song called Sex, but she refers to each act as making love together. <break time="150ms"/> So, who’s to say that these alternate types of role play aren’t feminist after all?

Hers is the voice of a generation spanning the sixties and seventies, with a catalog stretching so far that on a clear day you’d see it forever. <break time="150ms"/> From Broadway’s Funny Girl, to film’s Star Is Born, this goliath balladier sings and you don’t just hear that voice in your ears, you feel that voice inside your body. <break time="150ms"/> I’ve written about Babs a few times before, and that’s no surprise. This time I chose a pair of songs that weren’t huge pop radio hits, but ones that resonate with me personally.<break time="150ms"/>  Second is The Way He Makes Me Feel, a beautiful ballad from her film Yentl, though I confess not knowing of it from that frame of reference; I learned of it from the release of her 1989 Collection album, and it took on personal meaning when I met the love of my life (at the time), the one who shall always remain nameless, shortly thereafter. <break time="150ms"/> At about 2:13 into the song when she breaks into that sway-worthy bridge, I could honestly close my eyes and just die. <break time="150ms"/>Some days I wonder if he does the same thing if he happens upon this song.<break time="150ms"/> More likely he changes the station. <break time="150ms"/> First, then, is Prisoner, the theme song from a 1978 thriller called The Eyes of Laura Mars. In my opinion, it’s the only good takeaway from the film. Just listen to the sincerity in this woman’s voice. At the time, she had no rival. There were contemporaries, sure, and I’ve written about all of them at one point or another. But Barbra Streisand had no equal at the time this song was recorded. <break time="150ms"/> Girls, and of course some little closeted gay boys, belted the shit out of this song into a mirror, hairbrush in hand. I’m still like a prisoner captured by her majestic voice, and this prisoner is guilty of Stockholm Syndrome.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/55-to-55/54_Babs_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

        '<speak>Today is Donna day.<break time="150ms"/> Let the gods of disco shine their glittery countenance down upon us! <break time="150ms"/>Not much else can be said that hasn’t been said about the Queen of Disco. Perfect pitch? We covered that. Played to death until the record skipped? Yup. I will forever be enthralled by and enamored of Donna Summer, and almost all of her songs. <break time="150ms"/> But today we celebrate Heaven Knows and I Love You, respectively. <break time="150ms"/>Let’s start with the latter. I didn’t know of this one until I lived with my B.F.F. Vincent in Elmont in 1989. <break time="150ms"/> Talk about playing a song to death! If you think I’m bad, you never met Vincent. He would rewind his cassette tape (and we would hear the backwards rewind sounnd <break time="150ms"/> remember that??) continuously to listen to this song over and over and over. <break time="150ms"/> At the time I may have been annoyed but, in retrospect, it was everything. My love for this song, admittedly, isn’t as much about the song as it is about the memory. Obviously, he was obsessed with Donna, as most gay guys our age were, and that meant I was now obsessed with it. <break time="150ms"/> Fine, call me a follower and not a leader, as if I give a shit. <break time="150ms"/> This song is one among many of my songs on a personal playlist of songs that remind me of my Vincent. <break time="150ms"/> I don’t have a lot, so indulge me if you will. <break time="150ms"/> And then we move to the former. I can close my eyes and picture my #ToxicMasculinity making me sing the male verse in this song. <break time="150ms"/> Ha fucking ha. <break time="150ms"/>There I was, this tiny little closet homo living in the Pocono Mountains, in a house built for our family in A Pocono Country Place in Tobyhanna. <break time="150ms"/> I would play this song repeatedly, duhr, on my turntable. <break time="150ms"/> It seemed like a duet (which I love!) but it was billed as a Donna solo. After seeing the Donna Summer musical, I realized the male voice was that of her husband who sat in, as a fill-in, to record this song. <break time="150ms"/> Didn’t matter; I already heralded this as one of my favorites of her Greatest Hits. Rest Peacefully, sweet LaDonna Adrian Gaines. This may be the last time I speak of you. And rest peacefully, my sweet and amazing friend Vincent. I’ll never stop speaking of you.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/55-to-55/53_I_Love_You_Donna_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

        '<speak>Today is Olivia day. <<break time="150ms"/> Let the angels and the muses rejoice in the magic that her voice emanates! <break time="150ms"/> As stated the last few days about the last few featured divas, not much else can be said that hasn’t already about my beloved Livvie. Hers is the voice of my childhood, from as small as I can remember up to the tortured, permed-mustachioed teenager into which I eventually groaned. And somewhere between there lay her transformation, from country-pop sweetheart to sex-kitten chanteuse. <break time="150ms"/> Olivia’s album, Totally Hot, released in 1978, featured songs that were sort of a mirror of her on-screen transformation in the then-hot as fire film Grease, in which she starred. <break time="150ms"/> Represented on this album, in a more uptempo vibe than was her usual, was the leather-clad bad ass, trying to win over her man. <break time="150ms"/>Well, she won over this tiny homo. <break time="250ms"/> A Little More Love is sultry. There’s something in the air along with her perfect voice, and it’s hard to describe. She’s singing about her disappearing innocence while trampling our emotions with her range. <break time="150ms"/> Enter, again, the image of me singing into the hairbrush. <break time="150ms"/>Two short years later, but what might have been eons, the gods of everything good gifted us with Xanadu, probably one of the worst films ever made featuring Livvie and Hollywood icon, Gene Kelly. <break time="150ms"/> It had the ingredients for a blockbuster; sadly it was a bomb but for all the music on the soundtrack. <break time="150ms"/> One song I’ve already spoken about in my first year was Suddenly, the duet from the film. But today we zero in on Magic. <break time="150ms"/> Here we have this literal muse portraying a muse singing about the magic that muses do. <break time="150ms"/> In the movie she roller-skates around the forgettable male lead, effortlessly singing this song to inspire him back to art. And on my turntable, I’d crank the volume until there was more noise interference thumping from the woofers than music filling the air, and I would lip synch like I was indeed Kira in human form. It was one of the first 45s I’d ever owned, and it certainly got its share of needle grooves. <break time="150ms"/>It’s remembering moments like this I often wonder how my mother didn’t know precisely how gay I was. <break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/55-to-55/52_Brolivia_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

        '<speak>Today is Linda day. <break time="150ms"/> Let the wind and the rain commence upon us as we breathe in deeply the earthy graciousness that is her voice! <break time="150ms"/> I’m bewildered that it’s taken me this long to finally represent the beast of a voice that belonged to Linda Ronstadt. Honestly, I’m flummoxed. <break time="150ms"/> I guess she wasn’t as near to my radar as my other childhood divas, but in a world where retrospect is king and the past just seems to be a rose-tinted land of joy and innocence, I can hear songs by Linda and immediately recognize the perfection. <break time="150ms"/> We recently watched a documentary about this silken-voiced chanteuse, and it reinforced in me the joy many of her songs brought (and still bring) me. <break time="150ms"/> Today I’ll feature two; You’re No Good has that mid-seventies rock vibe that harkens back to A.M. radio and Midnight Special. I can almost remember her shag hair as she cradled the mike and not just sung, but felt this song. <break time="150ms"/> Therein lies the magic of Linda Ronstadt. A few years later she released Hurt So Bad. The sound was as amazing, but this time her voice was apologetic and hopeless in a delightfully perfect way. She made these lyrics come alive the way a singer should, the way a great singer does. <break time="150ms"/> Sadly, this song got shuffled around and lost in the fold of what was an oddball mash up of sounds converging in 1980. The airwaves were bulging at the proverbial seams with the burgeoning sound of new wave (Blondie) and the trickling vestiges of A.M. radio (Captain and Tennille), so this profoundly heartbreaking ballad ended up somewhere at the lower end of the year-end pop charts. Thus, today I challenge you to play this song and try and hear what I hear. To me, it still hurts so bad because of that perfect voice.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/55-to-55/"/></speak>',

        '<speak>Today is Debbie day. <break time="150ms"/> Let the witches and goblins, the faeries and creeps, the drag queens and punks shriek with delight, for their queen has arrived! <break time="150ms"/>In yesterday’s post about the cacophonous blend of genres hitting the airwaves in 1980, I mentioned Blondie because it was their sound and their songs that dominated the charts. Blondie was an act whose sound was so pleasing that it continues to cross boundaries, creating a hybrid of sexy thumping disco and sexy new wave rock and roll. <break time="150ms"/> To be the first act of its kind to accomplish that, fronted by a female vocalist whose voice was as electric and magnetic as her look, it’s no surprise I would repeat adding more Blondie songs to my countdowns. <break time="250ms"/> Call Me is an epic ride from a steamy film starring the hottest up and coming male movie star of his day, Richard Gere. <break time="150ms"/> There is no veil over the lyrics; they say what they say, and Debbie does not apologize for it. In fact, she owns the sticky heat that radiates from your speakers. This is a song worthy of cranking the volume. And whichever way your tendency sways, you’re not cheating on your go-to genre by loving every drop of this song. <break time="350ms"/> Same year, completely different sound: The Tide Is High. <break time="150ms"/>Reggae inspired, but a smash on commercial airwaves, this song stayed on the charts for more than a year, and has become one of the defining songs, for me, of my favorite year of music, 1981. <break time="150ms"/> I don’t really know any flowery words to describe the way this actual song makes me feel, except that it does make me feel.<break time="150ms"/> Clearly it’s a sense of nostalgia for a time when I hated life and wished I could go to sleep and not wake up, but every day that I did, music like this comforted me in my small wood-paneled bedroom, cuddling my blind poodle (not a euphemism) and wishing that longed-for starship would swoop down and take me to the far flung future. The tide was indeed high and I was, in fact, holding on, thanks to Debbie Harry and the boys of Blondie. <break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/55-to-55/50_Blondie_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

        '<speak>Switching gears from the past few days but also staying within the same time frame, because hey, why the fuck not, today is John day. <break time="150ms"/>Let everyone alive rejoice in the gift this beast of a musician bestowed upon us all those years ago. In all my posts, I have never spoken specifically about the icon who was John Lennon. <break time="150ms"/> In fact, I don’t even have to, because anyone bothering to read these posts knows all the gems with which Lennon had gifted the world. To say that he was what made the Beatles the phenomenon it was (and obviously still is, and likely always will be) is an understatement, but it’s also only half true: the partnership between John and Paul is the lore of legends. And, again, assuming you’ve been keeping up with my posts, you’ve heard countless times about Paul, but only in passing about John.<break time="150ms"/> So today, while I’m still in the headspace of the memorable period from 1980 to 81, we will review the final works of the late, amazing John Lennon. No one will ever know whether the release of the Double Fantasy album was actually the phenomenon we’ve all come to love based on its own merit (critics at the time hated it) or because Lennon was murdered shortly after the release, but it doesn’t matter either way. <break time="150ms"/> Three songs from that album changed my life, and introduced me to Lennon as a solo machine. <break time="150ms"/> Until then I only knew of his music as part of that larger wheel; and then, suddenly and unapologetically, the radio waves were clogged with his music, each song better than the last, each one more memorable for what it was. <break time="150ms"/> The doo-wop feel of Just Like Starting Over was exactly what the radio needed to help claim the stake of a waning genre, and it provided a blend of all the magic of the Beatles with John in the lead. <break time="150ms"/> And as usual, most of his music held a message to Paul. This song, in that realm, did not disappoint. He may have been married to Yoko, but Paul was his soulmate. The instrument-driven Watching The Wheels is one of those sway-worthy, harmony-prone ballads that just seems so reminiscent of the Beatles you could almost smell a reunion tour,  but, alas, to no avail. We just had to let it go. <break time="350ms"/>And then there’s Woman. <break time="150ms"/>To me, one of the biggest, strongest songs of 1981, one that tethers me to that year and brings to mind my mother, trapped inside herself in that smoky, wood-laden house in the forest. Songs like this remind me of our family outings to visit Uncle Joey in Freeland, always coming home in the black of night, usually in bad weather on narrow highways with giant trucks roaring past us while my father smoked and cursed and coughed. Trapped, Angie and I, and unable to ever speak of it. When I hear Woman, to this day, it is her essence that fills my mind, but it’s the sad, fragile version of her that I’d emulated in that solitary time. If only I could travel back and tell her. After all, I’m forever in her debt.<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/55-to-55/49_Double_Fantasy_Final.mp3"/></speak>',

        '<speak>What a happy memory out of 1967! <break time="150ms"/> Obviously, my earliest memories of this amazing power ballad, sung by the inimitable Dionne Warwick, way before she became everyone’s best psychic friend, are from my childhood in Lynbrook in the seventies. <break time="150ms"/> Even at such a young age I understood the magic of the music of composer Burt Bacharach, but in my opinion his music was always best when left in the hands (and velvety voice) of Dionne. <break time="150ms"/> Bacharach’s music dominated the sixties, but Dionne Warwick’s interpretation made them instant classics. <break time="150ms"/> This song is such a vibe. It can transport your soul to wherever you need to be, and once there you will end up happy. There’s honestly no better way to describe this particular song or the overall sound, other than to say it’s the kind of song that makes everything alright. <break time="150ms"/> How nice to know someone is looking after you in such a way that they begin every day with positive thoughts about you. I personally don’t pray, but it does seem nice that someone would pray for me!<break time="1500ms"/> <audio src="https://nebu-blogs.s3.amazonaws.com/music/55-to-55/"/></speak>',
